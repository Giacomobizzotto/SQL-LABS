Here is a portion of the exercises and examples I completed during my Database Management class, where we focused on mastering SQL using SQL Server Management Studio. Throughout the course, I learned how to write complex queries, perform data filtering and aggregation, use JOIN operations to combine multiple tables, and implement stored procedures for automation. Additionally, I gained experience in optimizing query performance, enforcing data integrity through constraints, and designing relational schemas. SQL is the most widely used language for data analysis, investigation, and manipulation in the business world, making it a crucial skill for companies to extract valuable insights and optimize decision-making.
